#my bashrc file

I created this sub folder because I keep losing my .bashrc changes when I switch computers.
This sub folder will make it easier to get my old .bashrc back.


## installation
1. copy .allias to any location
2. edit .bashrc to include "source /path/to/previous/.allias/file"
3. reload bash
4. profit !?
